It is
======
+ A tool to record stuff
+ A tool to record snippets

It is not
======
+ A heavy tool like Evernote/Wiz
  + Every unit should not be a long note.
+ A too light tool like Google Keep
  + Google keep has only a time dimension -- timeline, this tool has another dimension to construct multiple timelines and represent relationships between these timelines.
  + This tool makes heavy use of the other dimension besides time dimension.

Tips
=====
+ Define mark: a snippet.
+ Define flow: a timeline.
+ Every mark can be extended to a flow.
  + from:          to:
     =*======        =*=========
       \               \\
        [...]           [...]===
       /               //
     =*======        =*=========

Depends on
======
+ learn git
  + I'd like to try to use git/github to manage code.
  + GitHub's branch graph is just beautiful, try if it can be used in my flow view.
